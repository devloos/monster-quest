### Summary

This RPG, created in Python, draws inspiration from Pok√©mon and classic Final Fantasy games.
Developed using pygame-ce, an SDL wrapper, it's a project for self-education rather than a serious release.
I aim to upload it on itch.io for a more accessible demo experience.

### Getting Started

1. Be sure to install python on your machine. You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads
2. Install pip here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation
3. Create a venv of your choice
4. `git clone https://github.com/devloos/monster-quest.git`
5. `cd monster-quest`
6. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. `python main.py`

If you are developing make sure to toggle DEBUG true in `src/settings.py`

### Browser Deployment

1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `pygbag --ume_block 0 --can_close 1 --build --archive .`
3. Take zip in build to itch.io
